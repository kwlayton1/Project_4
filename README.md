# Project_4
Our group chose to work with a CSV file from Kaggle that classified patients into two separate categories, Abnormal and Normal, based on 6 different anatomical attributes. These attributes and their normal measurements are related to normal pelvic function and thus were classified as Normal. When attributes were outside of normative ranges due to disc herniation or Spondylolisthesis, patients were classified as abnormal. 

#Attributes of Consideration 
The 6 attributes that were taken into consideration for this data set included: pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, pelvic radius, and grade of spondylolisthesis. 
# Pelvic Incidence
Is a numerical value that represents the measure of an angle of two planes of the pelvis. In simple terms the pelvic incidence provides a numerical value to represent the relationship between an individual's pelvis and their spine. Each person's measure of lordosis is unique because no two people have exactly the same spine and pelvis. For this reason the norm is from +/- 10 degrees from the measures of each individual's anatomical landmarks. This measure increases as people develop and walk upright more often. Pelvic incidence is related to a condition called lordosis, which is a inward curvature of the spine that exceeds normative values.
